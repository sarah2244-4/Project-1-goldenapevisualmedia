##Design

###Colour Scheme

The colour scheme is greyscale in order to maintain a minimililstic feel to empahsise the images. The hero image is also in black and white as this is part of the site design rather than an image to showcase. Elements are contrasting with black and white to make them stand out.  

###Typography

Permanent marker was used as it gives the sense of being handwritten. It was used on the site/business name 'GoldenApe Visual Media' and in the about me greeting and thank you as they make the about me message and business name more personal.
Mukta was chosen for the rest of the site as it is a clean sans-serif font which reads cleanly and fits in with the clean site look.

###Imagery

All imagery used on the webiste is from a stock webiste which is referenced in the credits section.
